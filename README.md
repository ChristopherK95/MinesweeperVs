# Minesweeper Versus

## Introduction

#### A multiplayer 1v1 minesweeper game built with React, Typescript, SCSS and hosted on Heroku. 
#### And a personal project of mine.

The game is played like regular Minesweeper, with the addition of taking timed turns with an opponent and the goal to finish the game with the most points.

## Design
This repository contains the front-end of the site which has its very own server, while the back-end is handled on another server and has its own [repository](https://github.com/ChristopherK95/MinesweeperVs-server).
The communication between client and server is done with Socket.io.
